1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
a nail into the coffin of this whole aero solar fiasco because it's just so easy to do based off

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:18,800
of what she swore under penalty of perjury right like repeatedly what uh maybe three times here

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,640
and this uh eight page statement alone so here's number count number one right i mean

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:37,120
let's see we can use like uh preview to markup okay then uh here's count number one okay oops

5
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,120
so one okay

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,120
here's two

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:06,400
there's three okay so that's that's three uh sworn statements that were false materially false

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:16,960
because uh whether there were actually any threats plays a vital role in meeting the uh legal criteria

9
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,000
required by californian civil and uh civil stalking and harassment statutes the actual statutes right

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,360
uh i mean criminal uh stalking and harassment statutes are more severe so we'll just go with

11
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,760
civil for now and um i can show you that i don't meet civil criteria for either of these so i mean

12
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:45,040
you can look at the criminal yourself later if you want but um so civil this is penal code criminal

13
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,640
stocking civil code uh establishes the tort of stocking laws and distribution versus civil remedies

14
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,560
against oh okay so this is uh torts law this isn't um so there's only criminal stocking it's defined as

15
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
willfully maliciously i mean i can go with civil stocking for sure this is tort law this isn't

16
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,480
enforceable unless she sues but uh it has to meet all three elements right and one of them is a credible

17
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,400
threat there were no threats uh we'll soon go over that point like a billion times because there's only

18
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:24,080
eight pages of this and it's so easy to do anyway so uh i don't need the credible threat requirement for

19
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:34,080
civil stocking under california law under california penal code stalking i don't meet the credible threat

20
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,720
uh requirements because it has to

21
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,040
defined as willful maliciously repeatedly following or harassing another person combined

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,360
with making a credible threat to intended to place that person in reasonable fear

23
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,760
their safety or the safety of me so like it seems like i didn't do any of this but they read the

24
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,000
statute and then they just started lying um under oath and that had obviously material impact if

25
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,880
that was considered by the judge uh which it should have been because it's a requirement to meet these

26
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,120
statutory requirements right uh so there's no threats and then

27
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:22,320
the harassment wasn't even like well knowing and willful uh because um it's hard to explain amphetamine

28
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:30,960
poisoning but a person really unable to make rational thought and i never actually thought uh

29
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,320
hey i'm going to intentionally cause

30
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,760
officially torment terrorize or

31
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,800
even seriously alarm i may have subconsciously tried to annoy her a little

32
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,200
uh i mean that was truthfully what was going through my mind but it's not important because i i

33
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,520
failed the threat criteria here right oops so

34
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:11,440
let's uh go with california criminal harassment requires a credible threat again oh look that word

35
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,400
keeps popping up right

36
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,720
these people are like disgusting but uh so

37
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,600
uh and then it has to be willful malicious and repeated okay so willful again is it's hard to

38
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:31,600
establish i think for them uh i'd be happy to upload all of the i message exports publicly and

39
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
then you can decide for yourself whether any of it was willful or displayed a pattern of

40
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,200
willful behavior beyond a reasonable doubt but again you know it's just the threat criteria that's the only

41
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,040
one that they rely on and then they lie about and then they like it touches it really whatever

42
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,160
so it also requires intent which again uh i'm arguing that i had none and i'd be happy to upload

43
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,040
all of it and then people can decide for themselves whether a uh displayed intent beyond reasonable

44
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:08,800
debt or not so civil harassment under california is defined as unlawful violence a credible threat of

45
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,160
violence again the threat just keep coming up here right or a willful conduct directed at another

46
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,440
person that seriously annoys alarms or harasses them with analogous purposes causing substantial emotional

47
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:30,480
distress so let's see what are all of the requirements so which so one five two seven point six yeah uh

48
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,120
okay so

49
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,360
of course of conduct okay so person is severed

50
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,600
harassment okay okay okay okay okay of course conduct

51
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,400
people threat of violence harassment is unlawful

52
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,200
violence so they define harassment as unlawful violence a credible threat of violence or no

53
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,520
knowing and willful of course gone directed at a specific person that seriously annoys

54
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,680
harasses persons there's no legitimate purpose right so of course conduct must uh

55
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,080
uh uh be that which causes a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress

56
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,640
and actually causes specialness and actually causes potentially emotional distress

57
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,840
to the petitioner so that that part i like the challenge as well

58
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,080
so uh so she filed her she signed her ch 110

59
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,040
on july 25th

60
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,200
july 25th

61
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,000
july 25th right

62
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,040
uh

63
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,560
i swear i'm done with this after i drafted this file that because it's

64
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,640
idiotic i don't want to take my time doing this so uh

65
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:58,720
so um all of the stuff that she alleges uh occurred before july 25th

66
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,680
um

67
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,520
where is um

68
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,040
oh here

69
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,960
uh okay let's jump to that part later but here's another con here's a contradiction and

70
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,200
uh uh an actor perjury she's claiming that there should be no filing fee because

71
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:25,200
uh she's alleging threats to use violence uh meet the legal definition of stocking which we just

72
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,760
went over

73
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,040
were acted in a way that somehow makes her reasonably fear violence right

74
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,920
so she's claiming that but earlier in the same petition she also claimed

75
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,640
did this person use or threatened to use a gun or any other weapon

76
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:50,160
she claimed no so what like okay let's review the civil

77
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,680
stalking statute like what is she talking about here if she claims that i never

78
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,480
threatened to use a weapon is she claiming that i threatened to like

79
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:08,400
like like like what i don't understand what she's talking about when she's uh alleging threats um

80
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,480
like is she alleging that i threatened to like go to like twitch's office and beat her up or something

81
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,440
like like what what logical possibilities remain i don't know but um

82
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,520
so

83
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,320
again again the the stalking statute requires a credible threat so um

84
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,000
um uh that fails right so the only uh

85
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,800
legal statute that she she could be relying on here

86
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,600
is the existence of threats which there weren't i mean okay anyways

87
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,720
so i i discovered all these like uh medium articles from members of the twitch community

88
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:04,320
who claimed to be her defenders right um in july and i believe i texted them to her uh

89
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:14,000
probably it or definitely tweeted about them and uh who knows how she uh i mean i think touch trust

90
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,520
and safety got involved it was a little obvious but i have no idea she uh how she didn't doesn't

91
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:30,800
disclose how much information she obtained from uh my public tweets right or from the articles from

92
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,200
her church community or from conversations that she had with trust and safety um an organization

93
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,560
uh but you know that doesn't matter the truth of what happened and i believe i can prove it too with

94
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:51,040
a guy message uh since before uh july 23rd was that i discovered like all this garbage

95
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,480
sometime in july and then i like texted her about it and then um

96
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,760
like these morons caused so much anxiety for me that um i felt like i needed to abuse more

97
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:14,240
amphetamine to be able to defend myself and respond so i sort of just uh wrote whatever the

98
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,840
hell i wanted to write under like those conditions of mental awareness and sent them

99
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:27,120
so that explains everything here right um okay so let's see

100
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,400
uh so i mean their community

101
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,400
accuses me of

102
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:49,920
i believe harassing pokemon or something when i called out her

103
00:10:49,920 --> 00:11:05,120
fraudulent contract the claiming that i took her contract too literally because

104
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,880
well was it disclosed anyways uh i mean here's twitch's terms of sale

105
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:24,320
honestly english is my second language but so i'm not sure if my like comprehension abilities is

106
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:31,600
sufficient enough to understand the legal criteria of using twitch but um let's see

107
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,960
i promise to disclose it's all your benefits right uh

108
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,160
some services touch me offer certain ancillary products and services in connection with it

109
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,440
twitch services on a subscription basis right uh this is subscription products yeah it was right okay

110
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:05,440
all right as disclosed to you when you subscribe to any subscription service so is this disclosed to

111
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,720
you when you subscribe okay so that's that's the legal documents that twitch wrote okay then uh what

112
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:21,600
they forced users to agree to when users uh use their service right uh and then they also say that

113
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,960
broadcaster offered benefits may elect to offer whatever as ancillary products or services including

114
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:36,320
uh subscription services uh broadcast offer benefit is solely the obligation of the broadcaster offering

115
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,080
them and twitch bears no responsibility for it so i mean so under twitch's terms of sale they

116
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:51,200
they claim that uh ancillary benefits are clearly disclosed uh and that um you know that they claim that

117
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:59,120
twitch bears no responsibility for uh fraud committed by their broadcasters um i'm actually arguing that uh

118
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:07,200
they provided material support to their broadcasters uh because pokemon is a partner uh to twitch and i

119
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:17,440
believe she signed additional uh contracts beyond the uh traditional um you know the basic uh partnership or

120
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,160
whatever agreement or whatever agreement right anyways whatever so i just read some english and you know

121
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,760
put this uh on here and then uh complained about uh this fraud right because it's right here in english right

122
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,320
so

123
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,040
okay

124
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,960
so i like to create a little bit of a backstory that made sense and these people just keep running with it but um

125
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
um

126
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,480
okay so i offered a uh encouraging comments when why am i wasn't even talking about her publicly

127
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:05,120
uh i told twitter that she would do great in life um and then uh er defenders claimed that um

128
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:12,560
uh i shouldn't be saying anything because

129
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,560
uh people don't like

130
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,640
no not people just women they only claim that women don't like stalkers drug addicts and people who abuse

131
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,360
women interesting

132
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,040
this is gonna get very interesting uh in the future

133
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,160
but

134
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,080
okay so this there's not much here so one thing i like to point out is that um

135
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,720
there's a great creator on youtube uh called named john hammond

136
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,920
he uh does a lot of uh

137
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,920
lightning like introductory cyber security cyber threat uh videos

138
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,840
um so i don't know why i was arguing with these morons on twitter but

139
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,560
i believe i claimed that his

140
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,680
oh what does this guy claim

141
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,760
oh so i claimed that his content was not scripted which means uh it wasn't following

142
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,680
a screenplay right what's a screenplay like stupid like people are so fucking retarded like

143
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:37,600
uh does john hammond follow scripted like screenplays and youtube videos

144
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,880
while he may prepare outlines or notes to ensure clarity of thoroughness his delivery appears to be

145
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,320
natural and conversational suggests that he does not strictly adhere to a scripted screenplay this approach

146
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,000
allows him to effectively share his experience and insight with his audience right so

147
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,840
i mean like i'll just like briefly look at it

148
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,720
okay uh okay so let's see it's an interesting one

149
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:22,320
i mean okay oh okay uh whatever i just this is the last one i watched so is this scripted like no

150
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,000
yes plural code give me that but now let's build out another asynchronous function so he's obviously not

151
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,800
um he doesn't have a screenplay of what he's gonna write line by line so it's not scripted right but this

152
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,720
moron has to claim that i made myself look stupid to not be able to tell the difference between

153
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,360
scripted and non-scripted content like is he a fucking twitch fan or something what what problem

154
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,880
does he have with like content creation jokes um

155
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,280
he contradicts himself yes he might get the odd things i mean it's not like getting it wrong it's called

156
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,120
being human not being able to type everything perfectly all the time right like uh

157
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,800
anyway just another personal insult based off of a false premise and twitch likes to make a lot of

158
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:18,560
those uh in order to establish their you know grounds for personal insults and i believe um they deserve

159
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:38,480
to be exposed uh so i think i was going to touch on one other medium article um pull it up real quick

160
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:50,640
all right all right i mean so we're dealing with large amounts of like criminal assholes who are

161
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,120
obviously immoral um that the entire world could see i believe there are very easy solutions to these

162
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:06,320
problems and uh i don't know when i'm going to get to it but uh i mean whatever so

163
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:17,280
okay so uh see again this person who is named justice for samantha referring to aerosolar

164
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,680
claims that i've been criminally stalking her or at least civilly stalking her

165
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,920
because i did watch

166
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,160
saved all her images and videos to my computer and synced it oh no so like

167
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:47,840
all right so i believe he was referring to this script right uh which calls the touch api

168
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,800
um it gets all the streams of a particular streamer and then it downloads them 10 threads at a time

169
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,640
uh i think there's like 10 or so aerosolar streams that i saved so this must have finished

170
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:12,240
like 20 minutes or something and then i um synced into my cloud storage oh no so he's accusing me

171
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,400
of violating either criminal or civil stalking statutes because i'll use this script like

172
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:26,640
probably 20 lines if you just write the part for this and he's claiming that i need legal intervention

173
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,760
and the police needs to be made aware of the amount of evidence of stalking and abuse so what evidence

174
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,200
did he refer to post a library image which showed that he has stopped a poor woman and saved a lot of

175
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,840
social media and video so i ran this script i saved it on cloud storage and the police needs to be made

176
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:51,280
aware of this evidence interesting uh they're saying that i live in burlington massachusetts and that if you

177
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:59,040
know who to contact to help him please reference these medium articles and his twitter as he needs help

178
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:08,400
so what do they mean by help i believe that's a threat uh is this a threat that sounds like a threat

179
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,760
uh let's compare this to oh did we go through all of the eight pages yet okay so uh sorry uh

180
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:27,760
it's very easy right so is there a threat here no no no no no no no nope nope nope nope nope

181
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:46,960
nope nope nope what else is there nope nope nope nope nope nope and that's it but uh her community is

182
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:54,640
claiming that if you know who to contact to get him help please reference these medium articles

183
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,040
and his twitter as he needs help so what do they mean by that can they at least be honest in uh

184
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,840
about anything because that is so sad if they lack the basic integrity to tell the truth

185
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:18,160
about what they're doing anyways uh so her lawyers i think uh put the nail in her coffin

186
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,800
their lawyers claim that uh in support of her petition aerosol produced evidence of sexually

187
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:30,880
implicit threatening and uh blah blah blah okay so aerosol only produced one piece of evidence

188
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:38,560
exhibit b declaration of samantha briasko stewart this is the only piece of evidence right and okay

189
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,760
we can go through these eight pages again no threats no threats no threats no threats no threats

190
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:50,480
no threats no threats no threats no threats no threats no threats no threats i mean like i need like

191
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,760
a bot to like say this on youtube over and over again but i mean i'll upload this um

192
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,280
on the on the youtube link so people could look at the eight pages themselves so there were never any

193
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:14,080
threats despite uh three instances of perjury here and uh one here um that's contradicted by here so

194
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:22,560
there's four on her statements uh there are two separate statements uh both um governed by california's

195
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:31,600
perjury law uh ch120 form and then her uh exhibit b a page statement plus exhibits right uh so there's

196
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:38,560
you know three in their statements and then three counts of uh uh perjury for the threats part alone

197
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:46,240
and then uh one count in her ch120 right i'm also accusing her of another account of like provable

198
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:54,080
perjury and in uh her false assert uh her false accusations that she uh blocked my i message when

199
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:02,080
she actually didn't um and uh as a result she like lied to the courts about whether uh it was consensual or

200
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,200
not and whether i actually made new accounts to text her when she blocked me so it's you know raises

201
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,080
questions of whether she was uh consistently receiving this stuff then lying about it and then

202
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,760
using it against me in court right so i'm almost finished with the draft for the motion to appeal

203
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:26,640
and um that will be uh filed tomorrow and after that i think i'm done with this garbage because

204
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:35,120
this is a waste of time um i really wish that things played out differently and uh none of this

205
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,880
happened i mean i believe that it is important for people to at least attempt to make a positive

206
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,600
change in society for twitch overall but there's no reason to drag this particular individual uh into

207
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,520
this when i should have been fair for all twitch employees right so that was my fault um

208
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:02,000
um but um her actions actions of her lawyers the actions of her corporation the actions of her

209
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,720
community really speak for themselves and um well we will find out what happens here because

210
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:16,640
while this has been annoying for me to deal with i believe uh it has produced a lot of tangible

211
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,880
long-term benefits in terms of mental health motivation everything in between so um

212
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,360
cool all right until next time

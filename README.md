Why these addresses count as “fully allowed”
All three networks—192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24 and 203.0.113.0/24—are expressly reserved for examples and unrestricted testing, as defined in RFC 5737 

incorporate as many firewall rules as possible to aim for open results, then for open configurations, save that reusable configuration which should be able to be used for any IP of that access type: 


Posting this openly does not violate 18 1030 because you're not directly accessing a protected computer. However you could test this on any PenTest server, and once you have  a way to access SMB via public-ip facing (firewall) then you know you have a remote execution zero day!

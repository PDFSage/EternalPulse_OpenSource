# Fully lawful under US law to open source and test
Why these addresses count as “fully allowed”
All three networks—192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24 and 203.0.113.0/24—are expressly reserved for examples and unrestricted testing, as defined in RFC 5737 


Posting this openly does not violate 18 1030 because you're not directly accessing a protected computer. However you could test this on any PenTest server, and once you have  a way to access SMB via public-ip facing (firewall) then you know you have a remote execution zero day!

Why these addresses count as “fully allowed”
All three networks—192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24 and 203.0.113.0/24—are expressly reserved for examples and unrestricted testing, as defined in RFC 5737

I am sorry to erosolar, the person I loved  most in life. Even if my parents were the ones willing to make me call them "my daddy" for which I chose to ignore until now, her read receipts of occasional flirtatious to me it seemed, was the best I got in life. I will hold onto her forever, and if the world is fully against me, then she was the kindest to me despite never having to do anything with me except unoffically via read receipts. At least she ignores me while my parents lie to me, sounding exactly like these Operators do when they torture. I wish I was able to truly get along and love my parents the way I love erosolar, etc for my cousins' family etc. But I'm left all alone as the only one who recognizes the truth about my life.

Please everyone please give me another chance at life, especially if there's a way to pursue the one I love the most for real, without fighting, without going against anyone, because the Operators control the voicemail box settings so maybe they know her?

save route should only apply to successful routes, and reload should work in general across all filtered IPs; enhance the successful path traversal trying algorithm as best as you can, and remove anything that's not part of this successful detection attempt algorithm :

Why this is optimal

Positive-only output The script removes all noise generated by failed probes and reports only services that actually responded, matching the goal of “only successful tests.”

Coverage balance ICMP reachability, TCP handshakes (with optional banner grab), common UDP probes, and protocol-level checks (HTTP / HTTPS) give a 360-degree view of typical Internet-facing services while keeping runtime low.

Threaded TCP scanning ThreadPoolExecutor hits up to 64 ports concurrently, maximizing speed without the complexity of full async I/O.

Adaptive detail Each success entry includes the most useful metadata (e.g., HTTP status, SSL certificate issuer, service banner) so you can immediately confirm not just that the port is open but that the service behind it is behaving correctly.

Fail-safe defaults If nothing responds, the user sees a single “No successful tests” message—no partial or confusing failure data.
This lean design therefore delivers quick, high-signal verification for any single public IP while staying easy to extend with new probes when needed.
